### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
  
  
### What I learned

I learned how to use @keyframes to make transition movement of the circle in the projects, it was tough figuring it out.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  
  @keyframes circles 
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  0% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(0);
  }
}

```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://Googlefont.com) - This helped in getting the accurate font for this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
